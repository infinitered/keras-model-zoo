## How to Contribute

### Hosting the Model

**We will host the model file.** Do a pull request with your updates and a link to your model. During review we will download and host your model on our S3 so you can update your pull request URL to one that we will host. You simply need to find a way to get your model in our hands temporarily and we'll take on the hosting for the repo.

### Your Pull Request

Update the README.md to have all the information on your provided model. Then add a folder in the `/info` section that includes credit, examples, and more friendly information on your trained keras model.
